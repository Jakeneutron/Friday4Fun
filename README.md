# This Mod was made using "Friday Night Funkin' - Psych Engine" v0.4
Engine originally used on [Mind Games Mod](https://gamebanana.com/mods/301107), intended to be a fix for the vanilla version's many issues while keeping the casual play aspect of it. Also aiming to be an easier alternative to newbie coders.

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

# Friday 4 Fun (Christmas Demo)!!

One desperately wants a PS5, the other wants to catch up with an old friend! All made for fun! F4F will be a compilation mod for executing little week ideas! The first two being:

* Bestbuy BumRush Week:
- Jake and his friends have visited countless stores in order to acquire the allusive PS5... but it's always out of stock... and Jake is losing his mind.

* Ramses Week:
- BF brings GF along to catch up with his old upperclassmen friend Ramses from Highschool, but is a little surprised to learn how much has changed for him, but so little for Ramses.

AND NOW

* Ele.OS Demo!
and
* Bonus Ramses Song!

Hope you have some fun, Happy Holidays!
